    During my time at IIT KGP I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

    I spent a lot of my free time as a member of *Eastern Technology Music Society* and *Western Technology Music Society* taking on the eminent *Governor* role in 2019 and 2020 respectively.
